ðŸ“¦ Walmart Sales Forecasting

This project analyzes and forecasts weekly sales data across multiple Walmart stores to help improve inventory management and demand planning.

ðŸ§  Objectives:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, seasonality, and outliers
- Understand how external factors like CPI, temperature, fuel price, and unemployment affect sales
- Detect store-level performance differences
- Build forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, etc.) to predict sales for the next 12 weeks

ðŸ“Š Project Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

- Investigate weekly sales trends
- Study relationships with CPI, unemployment, holidays, and temperature
- Identify top and bottom performing stores

3. Feature Engineering

- Create lag variables and time-based features (month, holiday flag, etc.)

4. Forecasting

- Use ARIMA/SARIMA for univariate forecasting per store
- Forecast next 12 weeks of sales for each store

5. Evaluation

- Evaluate model performance using RMSE.
